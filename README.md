# code challenge
This challenge consists of indexing and searching for words in the titles of files and also in their content using the clause "AND". The main goal is to perform the search in less than 0.01 seconds. Indexing may take longer.
You can search for walt disney or disney walt and the results must be the same.
This project shows how I've implemented it using the hash table concept.
